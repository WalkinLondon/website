I am working on various artificial intelligence topics, including computer vision, human-computer interaction, and intelligent vehicles. My long-term research interests focus on **human understanding and generation (HuG)**, leveraging computer vision and deep learning approaches to track human motion, analyse human behaviours, and generate digital humans. My ultimate goal is to enable machines to understand humans and leverage AI to transform human lifestyles.
