I am a Research Fellow in the School of Computer Science at **University of Birmingham**. I am now working with [Prof. Hyung Jin Chang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=3TggrEkAAAAJ&hl=en) on *Human Gaze Analysis*, *Face Animation* and *Hand-Object Interaction*. 
Prior to this, I had the opportunity to work alongside [Prof. Ales Leonardis](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=BEFl4j0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Mohan Sridharan](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=pKV2QvsAAAAJ) on projects related to *Human-Robot Interaction* and *Augmented Reality*.

I obtained Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from **Beihang University** in 2023. My Ph.D. supervisor was [Prof. Feng Lu](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=9ggbm0QAAAAJ&hl=en). I am so glad to be the first Ph.D student of Prof. Feng Lu. I received B.S. degree of Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2017.
